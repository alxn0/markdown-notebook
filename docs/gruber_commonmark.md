# Some differences between Gruber's markdown and CommonMark 

CommonMark[^ref1] provides a strictly defined specification for Markdown syntax
that aims to resolve ambiguities and inconsistencies that existed in John
Gruber's original Markdown implementation[^ref2]. 

There is implementations of CommonMark in doznes of programming
language[^ref3] and various sites, mainly GitHub, GitLab and Stack
Exchange.

Below are some of the main differences or more strictly defined syntax in CommonMark.

See the commonmark web page for the full specification[^ref4] and
dingus[^ref5] for interactive testing

**ATX Headings**:
- *Gruber's markdown* allow zero, 1 or more spaces between the `#`
  and the header text
- *CommonMark* requires to be only 1 space after the `#`

**Emphasis and strong emphasis**:

In *CommonMark*:
- There is no intrawords emphasis with `_`
- Strong emphasis are defined by three `*` or `_` (i.e., bold and
  italic)
- Clear distinction between `*` and `_` which facilitate nested emphasis

```
this_is_not_emphasis_while_**this_is**
***Strong emphasis***
**Nested _emphasis_**
```

**Indented code blockes**:
- *Gruber's Markdown* allows for indented code blocks **at least 4 spaces or a tab**,
- *CommonMark* requires a code block to be indented by **exactly four spaces
or one tab**.

```
Paragraph

    Indented code block
    with consistent indentation
```

**Fenced code blocks**: 

*CommonMark* provides a way to specify code blocks with
three backtick `` ` `` or tilde `~`

```
~~~ 
a = b
b = c
~~~

```

**Lists**:

*Gruber's Markdown*: 
- lists can be somewhat ambiguous, especially for nested
  lists and the required indentation.

*CommonMark*:
- A list can interrupt a paragraph
- There can be one to 4 spaces between the list characters (e.g.,
  `-`) and the text[^info1].
- Requires that continuation lines in lists be aligned with the
  text of the list item they are a part of.
- Nested list need to be intended at least to the first character of
  the parent list

```
This is a some text
- List that interupt a paragraphe
-  New item with more identation, see that the
   continuation is aligne with the previous line.
   - Nested list
```

**Escaped characters**

Any ASCII punctuation may be backlashed escaped.

```
\!\"\#\$\%\&\'\(\)\*\+\,\-\.\/\:\;\<\=\>\?\@\[\\\]\^\_\`\{\|\}\~
```

**HTML blocks**

In some respect, CommonMark is less restrictive here.

*Gruber markdown*:

- HTML block need to be preceded by a blank line
- Does not allow the start tag to be indented
- requires a matching end tag, also not indented

*CommonMark*:

- HTML blocks continue until they are closed by their appropriate end condition, 
  or the last line of the document or other container block.
- **No blank line inside HTML block**

**Thematic Breaks**:
- *Gruber's Markdown*: Uses horizontal rules but may be inconsistent in
    parsing different formats.
- *CommonMark*: A line with three or more  `*` ,  `-` , or  `_`  characters, which
    can be separated by spaces but not by other characters, forms a thematic
    break.
